# Seids
&nbsp;
<p>The name ‘Seids’ comes from knowing each seed we plant carries their own identity with their shape, colour and flavour therefore creating an ID for each. This is where ‘Seeds’ became ‘Seids’.

Seids primary goal is provide information and key rules when planting seeds for indoor and outdoor plants out as well as edible plants such as strawberry and tomato plants. It contains simple but useful information for both beginners and well established gardeners needing some refreshing advice. Throughout the site it provides easy to view sections whereby the user can interact and note down essential step by step tasks as well l as following other useful links to social media platforms to see if other seed enthusiasts have any additional info from a personal stand point to help with any personal queries on seeds.</p>

<p>In everyday situations you find yourself trying to save money somewhere. This website helps people grow and eat healthy foods for less in a convenient way with a step by step process to help with each type of seed should you need it. The colour scheme through the site is the colours of a plant; a green top to represent leaves with a plain white middle for the essential content and a brown footer to represent the soil which plants grow from. I picked the primary colours from a RGB selector tool and the other variations of the colours come from those two colours. The greens HEX is #53BF9F and the brown is #725647 meaning enough colour contrast between the two elements when scrolling down a short page. You can also see from the image provided the different outcomes on multiple device screen sizes.</p>

The title is accompanied by a paragraph giving the user a brief description about what the site provides throughout. Below we have two buttons; one primary button and one secondary button. These differentiate between importance for the user and the primary button is filled showcasing that this is the more important button to click on.

<h3>Future Enhancements and Improvement of Features:</h3>

<p>In time this site can become a live e-commerce website with buying and selling becoming its primary feature alongside providing key information on choosing and growing plants. It can also include how to videos by well known plant experts from around the world showing users the types of plants from different climates. Also the one page of seeds can become a more in depth with individual pages for each seed along with its needs and requirements. </p>


I would also like to add something more interactive to make it more fun to use, its just choosing the right type of addition to make this happen in a logical but fun way. Last but not least I would add social media accounts because they would play a massive role in showcasing the information and products so that potential new users of the site would know what to expect when visiting the site either for the first time or for the twentieth time. </p>
