# Seids
&nbsp;
<p>The name ‘Seids’ comes from knowing each seed we plant carries their own identity with their shape, colour and flavour therefore creating an ID for each. This is where ‘Seeds’ became ‘Seids’.

Seids primary goal is provide information and key rules when planting seeds for indoor and outdoor plants out as well as edible plants such as strawberry and tomato plants. It contains simple but useful information for both beginners and well established gardeners needing some refreshing advice. Throughout the site it provides easy to view sections whereby the user can interact and note down essential step by step tasks as well l as following other useful links to social media platforms to see if other seed enthusiasts have any additional info from a personal stand point to help with any personal queries on seeds.</p>

<p>In everyday situations you find yourself trying to save money somewhere. This website helps people grow and eat healthy foods for less in a convenient way with a step by step process to help with each type of seed should you need it. The colour scheme through the site is the colours of a plant; a green top to represent leaves with a plain white middle for the essential content and a brown footer to represent the soil which plants grow from. I picked the primary colours from a RGB selector tool and the other variations of the colours come from those two colours. The greens HEX is #53BF9F and the brown is #725647 meaning enough colour contrast between the two elements when scrolling down a short page. You can also see from the image provided the different outcomes on multiple device screen sizes.</p>
